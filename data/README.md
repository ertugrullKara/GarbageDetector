This is the section to prepare and label the data.

Training, validation and test images can be either extracted from an image or can be placed as images.

To label the images, refer to 'YOLO_BBoxLabeler' folder.



Run 'prepare_data.py' file to generate images into 'raw_data/img' folder.
Place 'mp4' video files under 'raw_data' folder and it will automatically generate raw_data that is ready to
be labeled under 'raw_data/img' folder.

To label the images, refer to 'YOLO_BBoxLabeler' folder.
